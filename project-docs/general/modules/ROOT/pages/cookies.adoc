== Cookies (REQ-022)

React Router is a fullstack framework.
This means, part of the application runs on the server, manages data and renders the initial HTML.
Because of the server side part, it is possible to keep some part of the application state in a server-session.
To identify the session matching the request, a cookie is used.

A cookie has an "expires" and / or "max-age" attribute.
But the expectation of users is,
that as long as they are logged in and interact with the application, the session remains valid.
This means, the cookie must be automatically renewed.

The template should show-case how to implement this.
